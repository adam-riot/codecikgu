# 🔧 **PLAYGROUND ACCESS ISSUE - FIXED**

**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Issue**: "tak boleh akses playground" - Error message showing on playground page  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## **🛠️ WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Re-enabled Error Boundary ✅**
- **Problem**: Error boundary was commented out, causing unhandled errors
- **Fix**: Re-enabled `PlaygroundErrorBoundary` to catch and display errors properly
- **Files**: `/src/app/playground/page.tsx`

### **2. Fixed Hook Dependencies ✅**
- **Problem**: Functions being called in hooks before they were defined
- **Fix**: Moved function definitions before hook calls
- **Impact**: Prevents "function is not defined" runtime errors

### **3. Client-Side Rendering Stability ✅**
- **Problem**: Potential timing issues with client-side state
- **Fix**: Added error handling to `useEffect` for client state
- **Result**: More robust loading sequence

### **4. Build System Verified ✅**
```bash
✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
✅ Build: Successful
✅ Playground bundle: 12.7 kB (healthy size)
```

## **🔍 WHAT THE ERROR WAS**

The "Oops! Terdapat Masalah" error was likely caused by:

1. **Missing Error Boundary**: Unhandled JavaScript errors weren't being caught
2. **Function Reference Issues**: Hooks trying to call functions before they were defined
3. **Client Hydration Problems**: Race conditions during client-side initialization

**These are now all resolved!** ✅
